            <h1>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h1>

            <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties, except as required by law or as necessary to provide you with the services
                you have requested. We may disclose your personal information to our third-party service providers who assist us in providing the iTools API.

                We use industry-standard security protocols to protect the integrity and confidentiality of your data,
                and we restrict access to your personal information to those employees and contractors who need it to perform their jobs.

            <p>We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected,
                unless a longer retention period is required by law or regulation. We periodically review the personal
                information we hold to ensure that it is accurate, up-to-date, and still required.</p>

            <h1>Changes to This Policy</h1>

            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our information practices.
